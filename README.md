 Hey there!

Iâ€™m a computer science student at Rutgers University with a deep interest in full-stack development, quantitative systems, and applied AI. Lately, Iâ€™ve been building:

	â€¢	AI-powered finance tools with Python, React, and Firebase

	â€¢	High-performance C++/Python backtesting engines

	â€¢	Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines for smarter document search

	â€¢	End-to-end Dockerized apps with CI/CD and GitHub Actions

I love blending technical depth with practical problem-solving. Always open to new ideas, collaborations, or conversations!
