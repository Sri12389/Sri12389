Hi there 👋

I’m a computer science student at Rutgers University with a passion for full-stack development, quantitative finance, and building smart systems using AI & data. 

I’m exploring retrieval-augmented generation (rag), building finance tools powered by AI, and always pushing to learn something new.


Always happy to connect, collaborate, or chat about projects — don’t hesitate to reach out!
